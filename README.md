# Dota-2-Game-Regression-Model

#Introduction
The dataset that I picked for this experiment is related to popular online game DoTA2. DoTA2 is a massively multiplayer online role playing game(MMORPG). 
In the game, 10 players are split into two teams of five and the main objective of the game is to defend your base and invade your opponent's territory.
Each player selects a hero, or "champion", to fight in this game. During the game, players can have various of methods to collect gold to purchase better equipments. 
Stronger equipments upgrade and boost the hero's stats. In every one minute mark there will be a wave of smaller creeps, or soldiers, 
that will march out both bases to start invading each others territory. Players gain gold by killing the creeps in every last hit. 
The more last hit a hero gets, the more gold he will earn (more units killed = more gold). Players can also collect gold from killing another hero unit or destroying a turrent.
In the end, the gaming statistic will calculate the gold that a hero unit earned during the game per minute. We called it gold per minute(GPM). 
As of now, there are 113 unique hero units that players can choose from. One of the hero is called Anti-Mage, and it is one of the most picked heros in the game. So, my experiment 
here is to predict the GPM for Anti-Mage based on some given attributes.
